Navigating the currents of culture

In the currents of cultural evolution, the fate of written artefacts hangs on the delicate balance between cultural preferences and chance. How do texts, like living organisms, experience a process of preservation, transformation or extinction? To answer this question, the ERC-funded LostMA project will blend AI, complexity science and philological expertise to unravel the mysteries behind the deviation of textual transmission from pure chance. Focusing on chivalric literature in a European context, the team utilises deep learning for large-scale data collection on 4 000 documents. This groundbreaking approach not only scrutinises the transmission of texts but also challenges the role of chance in shaping cultural canons.
